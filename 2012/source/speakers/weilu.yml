subject: A Journey into Pair Programming
language: English
length: 25
summary: "What’s the deal with pair programming? Why do it? Is it for me? How to do it? This talk will discuss these questions by walking through one’s firsthand experience of switching from solo programming to pairing, as well as her takeaways gathered from pairing with various developers: ranging from the very experienced Jedi masters, to those whom she shares similar skill levels; and from those who read her mind to those who are very principled and opinionated. Pairing with different types of people has its respective pros and cons. Regardless, there are ways to make almost every combination of pairs work more efficiently and effectively than soloing, with both pair gaining valuable skills from the mutually beneficial relationship."
