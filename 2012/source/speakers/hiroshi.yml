language: English
length: 25
summary: "To discover the Ruby's defects is too difficult because they are in
hidden place. So we need high contexts and techniques if we try to
discover Ruby's defects without any ruby application.

A remarkable feature of the Japanese Ruby is that we have many Ruby
applications. A tDiary(http://www.tdiary.org/) is one of oldest web
application with ruby. tDiary has been growing up with ruby, and found
defects in ruby. Because tDiary uses Ruby functions that other
softwares do not use.

I will talk about Ruby's useful but rare functions and how to discover
Ruby's defects."
