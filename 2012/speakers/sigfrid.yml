summary: "Ruby on Rails is an excellent web application 
framework and it is a key part of Ruby popularity. However, when 
application complexity grows issues begin to appear, slow test suites and 
obese models are some of them. This talk summarizes my experience trying 
to deal with these problems and proposes an architecture that moves 
business logic out from the framework into Plain Old Ruby Objects, still 
using it as a delivery mechanism."
