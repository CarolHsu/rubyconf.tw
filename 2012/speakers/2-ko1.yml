summary: "As a member of Matz's team in Heroku, I'm working Ruby 2.0 to be
released in next February. Ruby 2.0 doesn't have drastic changes in
behavior except adding some new features. However, an internal of Ruby
2.0 VM is changing to improve performance! For example, we changed VM
data structures and method invocation processes to achieve fast
execution. In this presentation, I will introduce the internal changes
and its performance. This presentation is plus one version of my
presentation at RubyConf 2012."
