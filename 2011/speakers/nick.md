Nick Sutterer appreciates the beauty of elegant code, and the value of
open source software. Through his tireless development and advocacy of
the Cells and Apotomo gems, he has brought the concepts of
component-oriented UI development to the world of Rails, proving that
there should be no such thing as a double-render error, and that one
need not be slave to the great monolithic view mentality. Also, he
would like to have beer with you.

CRUD Is Not REST - Hypermedia For Y'All

## Extract

REST is an architectural style for distributed systems. However, many
implementations forget about the distributed part of REST and simply
map CRUD operations to HTTP verbs in a monolithic application. We're
gonna go further and learn why hypermedia is the crucial part of REST
architectures and how machines can browse resources just like humans
using self-describing representations.

Monolithic applications are boring, so let's separate things and
create a REST system as it is intended to be. Let's build a simple
system using the Roar gem, Rails and Sinatra and discuss the benefits
and drawbacks we get from distributed hypermedia systems.
