Nick Sutterer appreciates the beauty of elegant code, and the value of
open source software. Through his tireless development and advocacy of
the Cells and Apotomo gems, he has brought the concepts of
component-oriented UI development to the world of Rails, proving that
there should be no such thing as a double-render error, and that one
need not be slave to the great monolithic view mentality. Also, he
would like to have beer with you.
