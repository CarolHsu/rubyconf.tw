An Open CMS with MongoDB

## Extract:

It’s a disaster for a small company to maintain a self-developed CMS with thousands of clients. Each time the codes have been modified and we need to upgrade thousands of online websites, especially some websites have been customized, it’s a waste of customer service human resource. Now, we are using Rails and MongoDB to overcome the difficulty of upgrade. After the issue is solved, the bonus is that we can now open the system and invite other parties to join the development, create new functionalities and modules; meanwhile, we can still provide stable customer service of maintaining thousands and more online website.
