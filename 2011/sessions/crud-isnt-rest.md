CRUD Is Not REST - Hypermedia For Y'All

## Extract

REST is an architectural style for distributed systems. However, many
implementations forget about the distributed part of REST and simply
map CRUD operations to HTTP verbs in a monolithic application. We're
gonna go further and learn why hypermedia is the crucial part of REST
architectures and how machines can browse resources just like humans
using self-describing representations.

Monolithic applications are boring, so let's separate things and
create a REST system as it is intended to be. Let's build a simple
system using the Roar gem, Rails and Sinatra and discuss the benefits
and drawbacks we get from distributed hypermedia systems.
